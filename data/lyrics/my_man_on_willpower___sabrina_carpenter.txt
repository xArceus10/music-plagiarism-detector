[Verse 1]
He's clingy, he's loving, he always initiates
Callin' and touchin', it feels like just yesterday
He wanted all four of my personalities
Now I don't recognize this
[Pre-Chorus]
Stranger (Stranger) danger (Danger)
There in my bed at night
Wide-eyed (Dreamin'), ponderin' (Schemin')
What life without me'd be like
Can I return it, get back the version I like?
This one's bullshit, baby
[Chorus]
My man on his willpower is something I don't understand
He fell in love with self-restraint and now it's gettin' out of hand
He used to be literally obsessed with me
I'm suddenly the least sought after girl in the land
Oh, my man on his willpower
Is something I don't under, something I don't understand
[Verse 2]
He's busy, he's workin', he doesn't have time for me
My slutty pajamas not temptin' him in the least
What in the fucked up romantic dark comedy
Is this nightmare lately?
[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, okay, okay, he's on his big journey to find
A little zest of life, a new sense of purpose, but why?
I'm right here (Right here), I'm waving (Hello)
The joke can be over now
You're so silly, baby
[Chorus]
My man on his willpower is something I don't understand
He fell in love with self-restraint and now it's gettin' out of hand
He used to be literally obsessed with me
I'm suddenly the least sought after girl in the land
Oh, my man on his willpower
Is something I don't under, something I don't understand
[Bridge]
No, oh
My man's in touch with his emotions
My man won't touch me with a twenty-foot pole
My man's forgotten his devotion
Where he's gone, God only knows
[Outro]
Where he's gone, God only knows
