[Verse 1]
"Hi, I hope you're great
I think it's time we took a break
So I can grow emotionally"
That's what he said to me
[Chorus]
Here we go again, crying in bed, what a familiar feeling
All my friends in love, and I'm the one they call for a third wheeling
Probably should have guessed, he's like the rest, so fine and so deceiving
There's nobody's son, not anyone left for me to believe in
[Verse 2]
Me? No, yeah, I'm good
Just thought that he eventually would cave in, rеach out
But no siree, he discovered sеlf-control (He discovered it this week)
This week (Oh, ah)
[Chorus]
Here we go again, crying in bed, what a familiar feeling
All my friends in love, and I'm the one they call for a third wheeling
Probably should have guessed, he's like the rest, so fine and so deceiving
There's nobody's son, not anyone left for me to believe in
[Post-Chorus]
Believe in, no
Woah, woah
[Bridge]
That boy is corrupt (Ah)
Could you raise him to love me, maybe?
He sure fucked me up (Ah-ah)
And yes, I'm talking 'bout your baby
That boy is corrupt (Ah)
Get PTSD on the daily
He sure fucked me up (Ah-ah)
And yes, I'm talking 'bout your baby (Yeah)
[Chorus]
Here we go again, crying in bed, what a familiar feeling
All my friends in love, and I'm the one they call for a third wheeling
Probably should have guessed, he's like the rest, so fine and so deceiving
There's nobody's son, not anyone left for me to believe in
