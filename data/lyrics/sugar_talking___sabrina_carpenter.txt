[Intro]
Ooh, ooh, ooh
[Chorus]
Put your loving where your mouth is
Your sugar talking isn't working tonight, oh
Put your loving where your mouth is
Yeah, your paragraphs mean shit to me
Get your sorry ass to mine
[Post-Chorus]
Ooh, ooh, ooh
[Verse 1]
Saying that you miss me
Boy, do you win a prize?
You're havin' these epiphanies
Big word for a real small mind
And aren't you tired of saying a whole lot of nothing?
[Refrain]
You tell me that you want me (Want me)
But baby, if you need me (Need me)
[Chorus]
Put your loving where your mouth is
Your sugar talking isn't working tonight, oh
Say you're a big changed man, I doubt it
Yeah, your paragraphs mean shit to me
Get your sorry ass to mine
[Post-Chorus]
Ooh, ooh, ooh
[Verse 2]
You filled my whole apartment with flowers that die
The first to open up your wallet
But the last one to flag, a heart only breaks so many times
Save your money and stop makin' me cry
[Refrain]
You tell me that you want me (Oh, I know what you want)
(Want me)
But baby, if you need me (Need me), yeah
[Bridge]
Oh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
[Chorus]
Put your loving where your mouth is
Your sugar talking isn't working tonight, oh
Put your loving where your mouth is
Yeah, your paragraphs mean shit to me
It's verbatim what you said last week
It's your seventh last chance, honey
Get your sorry ass to mine
