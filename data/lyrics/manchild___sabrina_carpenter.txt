[Intro]
Oh boy
[Verse 1]
You said your phone was broken, just forgot to charge it
Whole outfit you're wearing, God, I hope it's ironic
Did you just say you're finished? Didn't know we started
It's all just so familiar, baby, what do you call it?
[Pre-Chorus]
Stupid
Or is it slow?
Maybe it's useless?
But there's a cuter word for it, I know
[Chorus]
Man-child
Why you always come a-running to me?
Fuck my life
Won't you let an innocent woman be?
Never heard of self-care
Half your brain just ain't there
Man-child
Why you always come a-running, taking all my loving from me?
[Verse 2]
Why so sexy if so dumb?
And how survive the Earth so long?
If I'm not there, it won't get done
I choose to blame your mom
[Chorus]
Man-child
Why you always come a-running to me?
Fuck my life
Won't you let an innocent woman be?
Never heard of self-care
Half your brain just ain't there
Man-child
Why you always come a-running, taking all my loving from me?
[Bridge]
Oh, I like my boys playing hard to get
And I like my men all incompetent
And I swear they choose me, I'm not choosing them
Amen, hey, men
Oh, I like my boys playing hard to get (Play hard to get)
And I like my men all incompetent (Incompetent)
And I swear they choose me, I'm not choosing them (Not choosing them)
Amen (Amen), hey, men (Hey, men)
[Chorus]
Man-child
Why you always come a-running to me? (Always come a-running to me)
Fuck my life
Won't you let an innocent woman be? (Amen)
[Outro]
Oh, I like my boys playing hard to get (Play hard to get)
And I like my men all incompetent (Incompetent)
And I swear they choose me, I'm not choosing them (Not choosing them)
Amen (Amen), hey, men (Hey, men)
