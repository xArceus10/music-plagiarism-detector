[Verse 1]
We were so happy, why not mix it up?
I'm so at peace, yeah, I can't drink enough
No way to know just who you're thinkin' of
I just wish you didn't have a mind (Oh)
[Pre-Chorus]
That could flip like a switch
That could wander and drift
To a neighboring bitch
When just the other night
You said you need me, what gives?
How did it come to this?
Boy, I know where you live
[Chorus]
Baby, I'm not angry
Love you just the same
I just hope you get agoraphobia some day
And all your days are sunny
From your windowpane
Wish you a lifetime full of happiness
And a forever of never getting laid
[Verse 2]
I think this schedule could be very nice (Very nice)
Call up the boys and crack a Miller Lite, watch the fight
Us girls are fun, but stressful, am I right? (Am I right?)
And you got a right hand anyway (And only yesterday)
[Pre-Chorus]
Was when we called it quits (Called it quits)
I was so confident (Confident)
'Til the thought of it hit
That any given night
You could be using your lips
On a girl with big tits
Boy, I know where you live
[Chorus]
Baby, I'm not angry
I love you just the same
I just hope you get agoraphobia some day
And all your days are sunny (Sunny from your windowpane)
From your windowpane
I wish you a lifetime full of happiness
And a forever of never getting laid (Forever, mm)
A forever of never getting laid (Mm, hmm)
[Outro]
At the end of the rainbow
I hope you find
A good whole lot of nothing
'Cause you're still inside
And abstinence is just a state of mind
