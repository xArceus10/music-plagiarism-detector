[Verse 1]
Touch my body tender
'Cause the feeling makes me weak
Kicking off the covers
I see the ceiling while you're looking down at me
[Chorus]
How can we go back to being friends
When we just shared a bed?
How can you look at me and pretend
I'm someone you've never met?
[Verse 2]
It was last December
You were layin' on my chest
I still remember
I was scared to take a breath
Didn't want you to movе your head
[Chorus]
How can we go back to being friеnds
When we just shared a bed? (Yeah)
How can you look at me and pretend
I'm someone you've never met?
[Bridge]
The devil in your eyes
Won't deny the lies you've sold
I'm holding on too tight
While you let go
This is casual
[Chorus]
How can we go back to being friends
When we just shared a bed?
(Yeah)
How can you look at me and pretend
I'm someone you've never met?
How can we go back to being friends
When we just shared a bed? (Yeah)
How can you look at me and pretend
I'm someone you've never met?
[Outro]
I'm someone you've never met (Yeah)
