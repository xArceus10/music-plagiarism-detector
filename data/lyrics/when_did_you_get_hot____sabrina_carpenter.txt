[Verse 1]
So long, untouched
Bone-dry, not a plant can grow
'Bout time I get
Back on the horse to the rodeo
[Pre-Chorus]
Now I'm at the prospect convention
My friends walk in your friends' direction
Said, "Sabrina, don't you know Devin?"
And I was like, "Huh"
[Chorus]
When did you get hot?
All the sudden, I could look you up and down all day (Hey)
When did you get hot?
I think I would remember if you had that face (That face)
I did a double take, triple take
Take me to naked Twister back at your place
Baby, baby, mm, it's thickening the plot
When did you get hot?
[Post-Chorus]
Uh-huh, uh-huh (Yeah)
Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh
Uh-huh, uh-huh (Yeah)
Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh
[Verse 2]
Congratulations on your new improvements
I bet your light rod's, like, bigger than Zeus's
Hey, wait, can you lift my car with your hand?
You were an ugly kid, but you're a sexy man
[Pre-Chorus]
Sorry, I did not see the vision (Did not see the vision)
Thank the Lord, the fine you has risen (The fine you has risen)
Big riff coming, I need a minute
Wait, I need a minute
Okay, here it comes
Oh
[Chorus]
When did you get hot?
All the sudden, I could look you up and down all day (All day)
When did you get hot?
I think I would remember if you had that face (That face)
I did a double take, triple take (Damn)
Take me to naked Twister back at your place
Baby, baby, mm, it's thickening the plot
When did you get hot?
[Post-Chorus]
Uh-huh, uh-huh
Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh
Uh-huh, uh-huh (What?)
Uh-huh, uh-huh
[Outro]
When did you get, when did you get (Uh-huh, uh-huh)
When did you get, when did you get so hot? (Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh)
When did you get, when did you get (Uh-huh, uh-huh)
When did you get, when did you get so hot?
When did you get, when did you get (Uh-huh, uh-huh)
When did you get, when did you get so hot? (Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh)
When did you get, when did you get (Uh-huh, uh-huh)
When did you get, when did you get—
