[Intro]
Take your shoes off
[Verse 1]
Thank you for dinner, baby, I had a really great time
I really loved the conversation and that your car self-drives
The pineapple air freshener is my favorite kind
Well, this is me, but if you have time
[Chorus]
Do you want the house tour?
I could take you to the first, second, third floor
And I promise none of this is a metaphor
I just want you to come inside
Baby, what's mine is now yours
[Verse 2]
The couch is really comfy, comfy
Got some Chips Ahoy if you’re hungry, hungry (Oh)
You don't need to love me, love me, lovе me
I'm just so proud of my design (To dim the lights)
[Chorus]
Do you want thе house tour?
I could take you to the first, second, third floor (I could take you to the—)
And I promise none of this is a metaphor (And I promise none of—, ah)
I just want you to come inside (Come inside)
But never enter through the back door
House tour
Yeah, I spent a little fortune on the waxed floors
We can be a little reckless ’cause it's insured
I'm pleasured to be your hot tour guide
Baby, what's mine is now yours (Woo)
[Post-Chorus]
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Co-come on, babe, oh
Oh baby, if you come inside, if you come inside
I might let you, uh
[Bridge]
My house is on Pretty Girl Avenue
My house was especially built for you
Some say it's a place where your dreams come true
My house could be your house too
[Outro]
Oh (House tour)
So, um
(To the first, second, third floor)
(House tour)
(And I promise this is not a metaphor)
Are you coming in or what?
