[Verse 1]
Love when happy hour comes at 10 a.m. o'clock on a Tuesday
Guess a broken heart doesn't care that I just woke up
Got a soft spot for a bev and a boy that's fruity
Can't lie, whole week's been tough
[Pre-Chorus]
No party invitations, not goin' to the club
[Chorus]
I'm just drinking to call someone
Ain't nobody's safe when I'm a little bit drunk
Could be John or Larry, gosh, who's to say?
Or the one that rhymes with "villain" if I'm feelin' that way
Oh, I'm just drinking to call someone
A girl who knows her liquor is a girl who's been dumped
Sippin' on my go-go juice, I can't be blamed
Some good old-fashioned fun sure numbs the pain
[Verse 2]
Ring, ring, ring, yeah, it's super important
(How many shots in an ounce?)
I might have double vision, but that is irrelevant right now
(Answer me, baby, um, are you in town?)
If you're still disinterested in me, well, fuck
[Pre-Chorus]
Just tryin' different numbers, didn't think that you'd pick up
[Chorus]
I'm just drinking to call someone
Ain't nobody's safe when I'm a little bit drunk
Could be John or Larry, gosh, who's to say?
Or the one that rhymes with "villain" if I'm feelin' that way
Oh, I'm just drinking to call someone
A girl who knows her liquor is a girl who's been dumped
Sippin' on my go-go juice, I can't be blamed
Some good old-fashioned fun sure numbs the pain
[Bridge]
Ba-da-da, da-da-da, da-da-da-da
Ba-da-da, da-da-da
How's yous been? What's up?
Ba-da-da, da-da-da, da-da-da-da
Bye, it's me, how's mm-call, do you me still love?
Ba-da-da, da-da-da, da-da-da-da
Ba-da-da, da-da-da
Should we hooks up?
Ba-da-da, da-da-da, da-da-da-da
Bye, it's me, how's mm-call, do you me still love?
[Chorus]
I'm just drinking to call someone
Ain't nobody's safe when I'm a little bit drunk
Could be John or Larry, gosh, who's to say?
Or the one that rhymes with "villain" if I'm feelin' that way
Oh, I'm just drinking to call someone
A girl who knows her liquor is a girl who's been dumped (Girl who's been dumped)
Sippin' on my go-go juice, I can't be blamed (Oh-oh)
Some good old-fashioned fun sure numbs the pain
