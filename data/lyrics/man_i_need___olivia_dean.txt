[Intro]
Talk to me, talk to me
Talk to me, talk to me
Hm
[Verse 1]
Looks like we're making up for lost time
Need you to spell it out for me
Bossa nova on all night
It's like a type of alchemy
Introduce me to your best friend
I can come and slot right in
A satellite ain't even that far
I, I kinda wonder where you are
[Pre-Chorus]
Already know I can't leave it alone
You're on my mind, mm
Already gave you the time and the place
So, don't be shy
[Chorus]
Just come be the man I need
Tell me you got something to give, I want it
I kinda like it when you call me wonderful
Whatever the type of talk it is, come on then
I gotta know you're meant to be the man I need
Talk to me
Talk to me
[Post-Chorus]
Mm, talk to me, talk to me
Be the man that I need, baby
Talk to me, talk to me
Be the man that I need, need, need
Mm, talk to me, talk to me
Be the man that I need, baby
Talk to me, talk to me
Be the man, man, man, man, man
[Verse 2]
I'd like to think you feel the same way
But I can't tell with you sometimes
So, baby, let's get on the same page
Stop making me read between the lines
[Pre-Chorus]
Already know I can't leave it alone
You're on my mind, mm
Already gave you the time and the place
So, don't be shy
[Chorus]
Just come be the man I need
Tell me you got something to give, I want it
I kinda like it when you call me wonderful
Whatever the type of talk it is, come on then
I gotta know you're meant to be the man I need
Talk to me, talk to me
Talk to me, talk to me
[Post-Chorus]
Mm, talk to me, talk to me
Be the man that I need, baby (Be the man)
Talk to me, talk to me
Be the man that I need, need, need
Mm, talk to me, talk to me
Be the man that I need, baby (Be the man)
Talk to me, talk to me
Be the man, man, man, man, man
[Outro]
Mm
Mm-mm, mm-mm, mm
Mm-mm, mm
Mm-mm, mm-mm, mm-mm, mm-mm, mm
