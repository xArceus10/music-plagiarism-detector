[Intro]
Mm
Mm-hmm
Uh
(Shikitah)
[Chorus]
I get wet at the thought of you (Uh-huh)
Being a responsible guy
(Shikitah)
Treating me like you're supposed to do (Uh-huh)
Tears run down my thighs
[Verse 1]
A little initiative can go a very long, long way
Baby, just do the dishes, I'll give you what you (What you), what you want
A little communication, yes, that's my ideal foreplay
Assemble a chair from IKEA, I'm like, "Uh" (Ah)
[Chorus]
I get wet at the thought of you (Uh-huh)
Being a responsible guy (So responsible)
(Shikitah)
Treating me like you're supposed to do (Uh-huh)
Tears run down my thighs
[Verse 2]
A little respect for women can get you very, very far
Remembering how to use your phone gets me oh so, oh so, oh so hot
Considering I have feelings, I'm like, "Why are my clothes still on?" (Mm)
Offering to do anything, I'm like, "Oh my God"
[Chorus]
I get wet at the thought of you (Uh-huh)
Being a responsible guy (So responsible)
(Shikitah)
Treating me like you're supposed to do (Uh-huh)
Tears run down my thighs
[Post-Chorus]
I get wet at the thought of you (I get)
Being a responsible guy (Responsible guy)
Treating me like you're supposed to do (Supposed to do)
Tears run down my thighs
(Dance break)
[Bridge]
No
So responsible
No
[Chorus]
I get wet at the thought of you (Uh-huh)
Being a responsible guy (Guy) (So responsible)
(Shikitah)
Treating me like you're supposed to do (Uh-huh)
Tears run down my thighs
(Shikitah)
