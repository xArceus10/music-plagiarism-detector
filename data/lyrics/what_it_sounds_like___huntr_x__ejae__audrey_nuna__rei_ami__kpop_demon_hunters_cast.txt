[Verse 1: Rumi]
Nothing but the truth now
Nothing but the proof of what I am
The worst of what I came from, patterns I'm ashamed of
Things that even I don't understand
I tried to fix it, I tried to fight it
My head was twisted, my heart divided
My lies all collided
I don't know why I didn't trust you to be on my side
[Chorus: Rumi,

I broke into a million pieces, and I can't go back
But now I'm seeing all the beauty in the broken glass
The scars are part of me, darkness and harmony
My voice without the lies, this is what it sounds like
Why did I cover up the colors stuck inside my head?
I should've let the jagged edges meet the light instead
Show me what's underneath,
I'll find your harmony
The song we couldn't write, this is what it sounds like
[Verse 2: Rumi]
We're shattering the silence, we're rising, defiant
Shouting in the quiet, "You're not alone"
We listened to the demons, we let them get between us
But none of us are out here on our own
So we were cowards, so we were liars
So we're not heroes, we're still survivors
The dreamers, the fighters, no lying, I'm tired
But dive in the fire, and I'll be right here by your side
[Chorus: Rumi]
We broke into a million pieces, and we can't go back
But now we're seeing all the beauty in the broken glass
The scars are part of me
, darkness and harmony
My voice without the lies, this is what it sounds like
Why did we cover up the colors stuck inside our head?
Get up and let the jagged edges meet the light instead
Show me what's underneath, I'll find your harmony
Fearless and undefined, this is what it sounds like
[Bridge: All]
(Oh, hey) This is what it sounds like
(Oh, oh, oh)
Hey, hey
This is what it sounds like
(Oh, oh, oh) Hey, hey
This is what it sounds like
(Oh, oh, oh) Hey, hey
Oh, this is what it—, this is what it—
This is what it sounds like
[Chorus: Rumi]
We broke into a million pieces, and we can't go back
But now I'm seeing all the beauty in the broken glass
The scars are part of me, darkness and harmony
My voice without the lies, this is what it sounds like
Why did we cover up the colors stuck inside our head?
Get up and let the jagged edges meet the light instead
Show me what's underneath, I'll find your harmony
Fearless and undefined, this is what it sounds like
[Outro: Rumi]
My voice without the lies, this is what it sounds like
Fearless and undefined, this is what it sounds like
Truth after all this time, our voices all combined
When darkness meets the light, this is what it sounds like
