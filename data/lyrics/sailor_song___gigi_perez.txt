[Verse 1]
I saw her in the rightest way
Looking like Anne Hathaway
Laughing while she
hit her pen and coughed
, and coughed
And then she came up to my knees
Begging, "Baby, would you please
Do the things you said you'd do to me, to me?"
[Chorus]
Oh, won't you kiss me on the mouth and love me like a sailor?
And when you get a taste, can you tell me, what's my flavor?
I don't believe in God, but I believe that you're my savior
My mom says that she's worried, but I'm covered in His favor
And when we're getting dirty, I forget all that is wrong
I sleep so I can see you 'cause I hate to wait so long
I sleep so I can see you, and I hate to wait so long
[Verse 2]
She took my fingers to her mouth
The kind of thing that makes you proud
That nothing else had ever worked out, worked out
And maybe I tried other things
But nothing can capture the sting
Of the venom she's gonna spit out right now
[Chorus]
Oh, won't you kiss me on the mouth and love me like a sailor?
And when you get a taste, can you tell me, what's my flavor?
I don't believe in God, but I believe that you're my savior
I know that you've been worried, but you're dripping in my favor
And when we're getting dirty, I forget all that is wrong
I sleep so I can see you 'cause I hate to wait so long
I sleep so I can see you, and I hate to wait so long
[Outro]
And we can run away to the walls inside your house
I can be the cat, baby, you can be the mouse
We can go forever or until you wanna sit it out
