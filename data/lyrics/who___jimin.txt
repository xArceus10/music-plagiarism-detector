[Chorus]
We never met, but she's all I see at night
Never met, but she's always on my mind
Wanna give her the world and so much more
Who is my heart waiting for?
[Verse 1]
Yeah, every day of my life
Then tell me why I haven't found her
(Why, why, why, why, why?)
[Pre-Chorus]
There's so many people to see (There's so many people to see)
And places to go (There's so many places to go)
I still haven't found your love
[Chorus]
We nevеr met, but she's all I see at night
Nevеr met, but she's always on my mind
Wanna give her the world and so much more
Who is my heart waiting for?
[Verse 2]
I'll take her places they ain't found yet
I'll put it all on the line
I'll be that someone she can count on
One, two, three, four, five
[Pre-Chorus]
There's so many people to see (There's so many people to see)
And places to go (There's so many places to go)
I still haven't found your love
[Chorus]
We never met, but she's all I see at night
Never met, but she's always on my mind
Wanna give her the world and so much more
Who is my heart waiting for?
Is she someone that I see every day?
Is she somewhere a thousand miles away?
Wanna give her the world and so much more
Who is my heart waiting for?
[Bridge]
(Who is my heart) Heart waiting for?
(Who is my heart) Heart waiting for?
(Who is my heart) Heart waiting for?
(Who is my—) Who is my heart waiting for?
[Chorus]
We never met, but she's all I see at night
Never met, but she's always on my mind
Wanna give her the world and so much more
Who is my heart waiting for?
Is she someone that I see every day?
Is she somewhere a thousand miles away?
Wanna give her the world and so much more
Who is my heart waiting for?
