[Verse 1]
I really thought I made up my mind
Hopped in the car and put it in drive
I tried to leave like a hundred times
But something's stopping me every time, oh-ho
[Pre-Chorus]
Faking a smile while we're breaking apart
Oh, I never, never, never meant to take it this far
Too late to save me, so don't even start
Oh, you never meant to hurt me, but you're making it hard
[Chorus]
Don't tell me that you're gonna miss me
Just tell me that you wanna kill me
Don't say that you love me 'cause it hurts the most
You just gotta let me go
[Verse 2]
I really thought this was for the best
It never worked last time that I checked
I got this pain stuck inside my chest
And it gets worse the further I get, oh-ho
[Pre-Chorus]
Faking a smile while we're breaking apart
Oh, I never, never, never meant to take it this far
Too late to save me, so don't even start
Oh, you never meant to hurt me, but you're making it hard
[Chorus]
Don't tell me that you're gonna miss me (Tell me that you miss me)
Just tell me that you wanna kill me (Kill me)
Don't say that you love me 'cause it hurts the most (The most)
You just gotta let me go
Lie to me, tell me that you hate me (Tell me that you hate me)
Look me in the eyes and call me crazy (Crazy)
Don't say that you love me 'cause it hurts the most (The most)
You just gotta let me go
[Outro]
Let me go
Gotta let me go
Gotta let me
Don't say that you love me 'cause it hurts the most
You just gotta let me go
