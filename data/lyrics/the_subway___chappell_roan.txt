[Verse 1]
I saw your green hair, beauty mark next to your mouth
There, on the subway, I nearly had a breakdown
A few weeks later,
somebody wore your perfume
It almost killed me, I had to leave the room
[Chorus]
It's just another day and it's not over (Ah)
'Til it's over, it's never over
It's just another day and it's not over (Ah)
'Til it's over, it's never over
[Post-Chorus]
'Til I don't look for you on the staircase
Or wish you thought that we were still soulmates
But I'm still counting down all of the days
'Til you're just another girl on the subway
[Verse 2]
Made you the villain, evil for just moving on
I see your shadow,
I see it even with the lights off
I made a promise if in four months, this feeling ain't gone
Well, fuck this city, I'm moving to Saskatchewan
[Chorus]
It's just another day and it's not over (Ah)
'Til it's over, oh, 'til it's over
It's just another day and it's not over (Ah)
'Til it's over
,
it's never over
[Post-Chorus]
'Til I can break routine during foreplay
And trust myself that I won't say your name
But I'm still counting down all of the days
'Til you're just another girl on the subway
[Outro]
She's got, she's got a way
She's got a way, she's got a way
And she got, she got away
She got away, she got away
And she's got, she's got a way
She's got a way, she's got a way
And she got, she got away
She got away, she got away
(She's got, she's got a way
She's got a way, she's got a way)
She's got a way (She got, she got away
She got away, she got away)
She's got, she's got a way
She's got a way, she's got a way
And she got, she got away
She got away, she got away
