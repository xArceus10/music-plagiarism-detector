[Verse 1]
I don't want anyone else
From the hours of 12 to 12
I am not the least compelled
By anyone but yourself
Look at me, it makes me melt
I know you wanna see me in hell, my love
I'm dealing with the cards I've dealt
While you're dancing with somebody else
[Pre-Chorus]
Was it always in your plan to leave eventually?
Because to me, there's no one else that could make sense to me
The last and final puzzle piece
[Chorus]
In a room full of people, I look for you
Would you avoid me or would you look for me too?
Tell me, is our story through? (Through)
Or do our hearts still beat in tune?
[Verse 2]
I've never felt anything
Like the love from my final days
Why'd you wait
To show me you could do it this way?
Woo, I'll never look at you, look at you the same
We met in a Paris café
I said, "Can I sit with you?
Comment ça se fait?
"
My mistake
If I'd known it would have been this way
I'd never looked at you, looked in the first place
[Pre-Chorus]
Was it always in your plan to leave eventually?
Because to me, there's no one else that could make sense to me
The last and final puzzle piece
[Chorus]
In a room full of people, I look for you
Would you avoid me or would you look for me too?
Tell me, is our story through? (Through)
Or do our hearts still beat in tune?
[Bridge]
Maybe I'm delusional
And the way you act is usual
Maybe in another world
I won't feel so unlovable (Unlovable)
Oh (Unlovable)
[Chorus]
In a room full of people, I look for you
Would you avoid me or would you look for me too?
Tell me, is our story through? (Through)
Or do our hearts still beat in tune?
In a room full of people, I look for you
Would you avoid me or would you see me through?
Tell me, is our story through? (Through)
Or do our hearts still beat in tune?
