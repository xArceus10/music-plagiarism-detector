[Intro]
Hey, hey
Hey, hey
Hey
[Verse 1: Jinu]
Don't want you, need you
Yeah, I need you to fill me up
마시고 마셔 봐도
성에 차지 않아
Got a feeling that, oh, yeah (Yeah)
You could be everything that
That I need (Need), taste so sweet (Sweet)
Every sip makes me want more, yeah

Lookin' like snacks
'cause you got it like that
(Woo)
Take a big bite, want another bite, yeah
너의 모든 걸 난 원해, 원해, 원해
너 말곤 모두 뻔해, 뻔해, 뻔해
When you're in my arms, I hold you so tight (So tight)
Can't let go, no, no, not tonight

지금 당장 날 봐 시간 없잖아
넌 내꺼야 이미 알고 있잖아
'Cause I need you to need me
I'm empty, you feed me
so refreshing
My little soda pop
[Chorus: All]
You're all I can think of
Every drop I drink up
You're my soda pop
My little soda pop
Cool me down, you're so hot
Pour me up, I won't stop
You're my soda pop
My little soda pop
[Post-Chorus: All]
My little soda pop

Verse 3: Baby,

Uh, make me wanna flip the top
한 모금에 you hit the spot
Every little drip and drop, fizz and pop, ah
소름 돋아 it's gettin' hot
Yes, I'm sippin' when it's drippin' now
It's done? I need a second round
And pour a lot and don't you stop
'Til my soda pop fizzles out

So, the wait is over, baby
Come and fill me up
Just can't get enough
Oh

You're all I can think of
Every drop I drink up

Cool me down, you're so hot
Pour me up, I won't stop (Oh, oh)
You're my soda pop

Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
You're my soda pop
Gotta drink every drop
