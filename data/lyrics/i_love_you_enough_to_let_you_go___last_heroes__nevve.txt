[Verse 1]
My heart is breaking
Hands can't keep from shaking
I love you
So I'll wait as I watch you go
[Pre-Chorus]
Helped you pack your bags
You hit the road just like that
I can't live in the past
If I set you free you might come back
Can't count on it
But i'd be glad I'll welcome you
With open arms, and open heart
[Chorus]
It it's worth fighting then we'll fight
I would be wrong to hold on thight
I love you enough to let you go
If you come 'round you were always mine
Then only then you'll know how
I love you enough to let you go
[Build]
I love you enough to let you walk out my life
I love you enough to let you go
(I love you enough to let you go)
[Drop]
(I love you enough to let you go)
(I love you enough to let you go)
[Verse 2]
You were searching
For something in the distance
How could I keep you here when you're not happy
[Pre-Chorus]
At the drop of a hat
You hit the road just like that
I can't live in the past, no
[Chorus]
It it's worth fighting then we'll fight
I would be wrong to hold on thight
I love you enough to let you go
If you come 'round you were always mine
Then only then you'll know how
I love you enough to let you go
[Drop]
I love you enough to let you go
