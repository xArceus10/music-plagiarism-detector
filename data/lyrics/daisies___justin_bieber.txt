[Verse 1]
Throwin' petals like, "Do you love me or not?"
Head is spinnin', and it don't know when to stop
'Cause you said, "Forever," babe, did you mean it or not?
Hold on, hold on
You leave me on read, babe, but I still get the message
Instead of a line, it's three dots, but I can connect them
And if it ain't right, babe, you know I'll respect it
But if you need time, just take your time
Honey, I get it, I get it, I get it
[Chorus]
Way you got me all in my head
Think I'd rather you in my bed
Whatever it is, you know I can take it
I'm countin' the days, how many days 'til I can see you again?
[Verse 2]
Blowin' kisses like, "Will you catch 'em or not?"
I'm Cupid with arrows, babe, I'm just shootin' my shot, mm-mm
If I could get in, drop me a pin, hop in the— and come over
Don't wanna be friends, just skin-to-skin, I wanna get closer and closer and closer, uh
[Chorus]
The way you got me all in my head
Think I'd rather you in my bed
Whatever it is, you know I can take it
I'm countin' the days, how many days 'til I can see you again?
[Bridge]
You got me all, all, my love (All in my feelings, babe)
And you got me all, I've been all in my feelings
And you got me all, all weak in my knees every time (You got me all in my head, you got me all in my head, you got—)
‘Cause you got me all, all in my feelings (You got me all in my head, you got me all in my head, you got—)
Every time
[Chorus]
The way you got me all in my head (You got me all in my head)
Think I'd rather you in my bed
Whatever it is, you know I can take it
I'm countin' the days, how many days 'til I can see you again?
