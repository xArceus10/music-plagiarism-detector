[Verse 1]
"Bullshit repeats itself," is that how the saying goes?
Been here a thousand times, selective memory though
I hear it in his eyes, he sees it in my tone
Is what it is and it's predictable
[Chorus]
All the "I love you's" and "I'm sorry's" were said
We had our sex and then we made amends, that's right
Called it a false alarm to all of our friends
Then we almost broke up again last night
[Post-Chorus]
We almost
Got so close
[Verse 2]
When I reach to pull the plug
I swear he starts working out
And on the days I'm a little much
That's when I tell him how sweet he treats me
And how no other boys compete
I know how it looks, I know how it sounds
[Chorus]
All the "I love you's" and "I'm sorry's" were said (Sorry's were said)
We had our sex and then we made amends, that's right
Called it a false alarm to all of our friends
Then we almost broke up again last night
[Bridge]
You say we're driftin' apart
I said, "Yeah, I fucking know"
Big deal, we've been here before
And we'll be here tomorrow
Oh
[Chorus]
All the "I love you's" and "I'm sorry's" were said
We had our sex and then we made amends, that's right
Called it a false alarm to all of our friends
Then we almost broke up again, oh
[Outro]
We almost broke up, we almost broke up again
We almost broke up, we almost broke up again
Gave me his whole heart, then I gave him head and then
We almost broke up, we almost broke up
Yeah, we almost broke up again
