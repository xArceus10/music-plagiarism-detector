[헌트릭스 "How It's Done" 가사]
[Intro: Rumi]
Ugh, you came at a bad time
But you just crossed the line
You wanna get wild?
Okay, I'll show you wild
[Verse 1: Rumi,
Mira
,
Zoey
]
Better come right, better luck tryin', gettin' to our level
'Cause you might die, never the time, tryna start a battle
Bleeding isn't in my blood,
뼈속부터 달라서
Beating you is what I do, do, do, yeah
Body on body, I'm naughty, not even sorry
And when you pull up, I'll pull up
A little late to the party
(La-la-la-la)
Locked and loaded, I was born for this
There ain't no point in avoiding it
Annoyed? A bit
불을 비춰 다 비켜, 네 앞길을 뺏겨
[Pre-Chorus: Rumi,
All
]
Knocking you out like a lullaby
Hear that sound ringing in your mind
Better sit down for the show
'Cause I'm gonna show you
How it's done, done, done
[Chorus: Zoey,
All
]
(Hey) Huntrix don't miss
How it's done, done, done
(Hey) Huntrix don't quit
How it's done, done, done
[Post-Chorus: All]
Run, run, we run the town
Whole world playin' our sound
Turnin' up, it's goin' down
Huntrix show this, how it's done, done, done
[Verse 2: Rumi,
Mira
,
Zoey
]
That's so humbling, huh?
갑자기 왜 그래? 먼저 건드려, 왜?
이제야 포기해
, what?
Nothing to us, run up, you're done up, we come up
From sunup to sundown, so come out to play
Won either way, we're one in a million
We kill 'em, like, really? You want it? Okay
Heels, nails, blade, mascara
Fit check for my napalm era
Need to beat my face, make it cute and savage
Mirror, mirror on my phone, who's
the baddest
?
(Us, hello?)
[Pre-Chorus: Mira,
Zoey
,
Rumi
,
All
]
Knocking you out like a lullaby
Hear that sound ringing in your mind
Better sit down for the show
'Cause I'm gonna show you (
I'm gonna show you
)
(
I'm gonna show you
)
How it's done, done, done
[Verse 3: Mira,
All
,
Zoey
]
I don't talk, but I bite, full of venom (Uh)
Spittin' facts, you know that's
How it's done, done, done
Okay, like, I know I ramble
But when shootin' my words, I go
Rambo
Took blood, sweat, and tears, to look natural (Uh)
That's how it's done, done, done
[Bridge: Rumi,
All
]
Hear our voice unwavering
'Til our song defeats the night
Makin' fear afraid to breathe
'Til the dark meets the light
(
How it's done, done, done
)
[Chorus: Mira,
Rumi
,
All
,
Zoey
]
Run, run, we run the town (Done, done, done)
Whole world playin' our sound
(
Done, done, done
)
Turnin' up, it's going down (
Done, done, done
)
Huntrix, show this how it's done, done, done
[Outro: Zoey & Mira,
All
,
Rumi
]
We hunt you down, down, down (
Down
; Done, done, done)
We got you now, now, now (
Got you now
; Done, done, done)
We show you how, how, how (
Show you how
)
Huntrix, don't miss, how it's done, done, done
