[Intro]
(But I wanna stay)
[Verse 1]
I want you to stay
'Til I'm in the grave
'Til I rot away, dead and buried
'Til I'm in the casket you carry
If you go, I'm goin' too, uh
'Cause it was always you (Alright)
And if I'm turnin' blue, please don't save me
Nothin' left to lose without my baby
[Refrain]
Birds of a feather, we should stick together
, I know
I said I'd never think I wasn't better alone
Can't change the weather, might not be forever
But if it's forever, it's even better
[Pre-Chorus]
And I don't know what I'm cryin' for
I don't think I could love you more
It might not be long, but baby, I
[Chorus]
I'll love you 'til the day that I die
'Til the day that I die
'Til the light leaves my eyes
'Til the day that I die
[Verse 2]
I want you to see, hm
How you look to me, hm
You wouldn't believe if I told ya
You would keep the compliments I throw ya
But you're so full of shit, uh
Tell me it's a bit, oh
Say you don't see it, your mind's polluted
Say you wanna quit, don't be stupid
[Pre-Chorus]
And I don't know what I'm cryin' for
I don't think I could love you more
It might not be long, but baby, I
Don't wanna say goodbye
[Chorus]
Birds of a feather, we should stick together,
I know
('Til the day that I die)
I said I'd never think I wasn't better alone
('Til the light leaves my eyes)
Can't change the weather, might not be forever
('Til the day that I die)
But if it's forever, it's even better
[Post-Chorus]
I knew you in another life
You had that same look in your eyes
I love you, don't act so surprised
