[Intro]
Ah-ah-ah-ah (Ayy, ayy)
Ah-ah-ah-ah (Ayy, ayy)
Ah-ah-ah-ah (Ayy, ayy)
Ah-ah-ah-ah
[Verse 1]
Like sugar on my tongue, tongue, tongue
Your body is so sweet, sweet, sweet
Invite me if you come, come, come (Come, come, come)
It's all I want to eat, eat, eat
[Pre-Chorus]
Tell your mama (Tell 'em what?)
Tell your daddy (Tell 'em what?)
Tell the bitches that you know
Tell your mama (Tell your mama)
Tell your daddy (Tell your daddy)
Tell the world (Uh)
Tell the world
[Chorus]
Like sugar on my tongue
Can I steal that from you?
Like sugar on my tongue
Can I steal that from you?
[Verse 2]
Are you from Harlem? Make your arms and legs shake, uh-huh
Give me that slice of cream, is it your birthday? Uh-huh
I got a brush, give me your walls and I'll paint, uh-huh
Don't need no air, I stay down there 'til I faint (Girl, I'm dead)
[Pre-Chorus]
Tell your mama (Tell 'em what? Tell your mama, uh)
Tell your daddy (Tell 'em what? Tell your daddy, uh)
Tell your mama (Tell your mama)
Tell your daddy (Tell your daddy)
Tell the world (Uh-uh, woah)
[Chorus]
Like sugar on my tongue
Can I steal that from you?
Like sugar on my tongue
Can I steal that before I go?
[Bridge]
You wanna eat me up? You wanna be my friend?
You wanna get me up and never be locked in?
I wanna take you down, you wanna be my thing
Oh no, no, no, no (Take me down, yeah)
Oh-woah, oh-oh (Eat you up)
Oh-woah, oh-oh (Girl, I'll eat you up)
Oh-woah, oh-oh-oh (I'll eat you up)
Oh-woah, oh-oh
[Outro]
Let me just taste it (Can I eat you up?)
Ain't gotta cuff or nothing (Eat you up, yeah, yeah)
I promise, I'll take you out on a date
Just trust me (Eat you up)
