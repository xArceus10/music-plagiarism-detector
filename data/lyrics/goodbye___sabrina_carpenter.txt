[Verse 1]
Broke my heart on Saturday
Guess overnight, your feelings changed
And I have cried so much, I almost fainted (Aha, aha)
To show you just how much it hurts
I wish I had a gun or words
If something got lost in communication (Aha, aha)
[Pre-Chorus]
Well, さよなら, adiós
You're not bilingual, but you should know
[Chorus]
Goodbye means that you’re losing me for life
Can't call it love, then call it quits
Can't shoot me down, then shoot the shit
Did you forget that it was you who said goodbye?
So you don’t get to be the one who cries
Can't have your cake and eat it too
By walking out, that means you choose goodbye
[Verse 2]
The feeling's so specific
Wanna punch you every other minute, oh
You used to love my ass, now, baby, you won't see it anymorе (Aha, aha)
Well, just give it three weeks, buddy
Gonna wake up from your coma, honеy, oh
And that's when you'll be holding hokey flowers, standing at my door (Aha)
[Pre-Chorus]
But I'll say, "Arrivederci, au revoir"
Forgive my French, but fuck you, ta-ta
[Chorus]
Goodbye means that you're losing me for life
Can’t call it love, then call it quits
Can’t shoot me down, then shoot the shit
Did you forget that it was you who said goodbye?
(It was you who said goodbye)
So you don't get to be the one who cries
Can’t have your cake and eat it too
By walking out, that means you choose goodbye
[Bridge]
さよなら, adiós
On the flip side, cheerio
Por siempre te amo, wait, no
Shit, when did you get here?
Go put on some clothes
[Chorus]
Goodbye means that you're losing me for life
Can't call it love, then call it quits (Can't call it quits)
Can’t shoot me down, then shoot the shit
Did you forget that it was you who said goodbye?
(It was you who said goodbye)
So you don't get to be the one who cries
Can't have your cake and eat it too
By walking out, that means you choose goodbye
Goodbye
[Outro]
Get home safe
